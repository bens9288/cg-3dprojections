<h2 align="center"> 3d Projections and Wireframe Models</h2>
<h3 align="center"> By: Promise Benson and Noah Wenck</h3>
<p align="left">
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp This project was made in order implement 3d clipping algorithms and animation. The models are made of vertex and edge table data. Each model is animated using a different type of rotation around a differnt axis. Clipping is implemented such that the endpoints of a model are not rendered when it goes off screen, seen using the red endpoints at the intersection point of a model and the edge of the window. The models are custom implementations of a cone, rectangular prism, circular prism and a custom house shape. The scene comes as different lists of models and edge tables that create different scenes. Many scenes are available to open using the Choose File button.

Controls: </br>
- Left and right arrow keys move the camera angle left and right </br>
- WASD moves camera around scene </br>
- Choose File button opens File Manager to change scene </br> </br>

This work is based on sample code made by tmarrian. This is also a group project with collaborator noahwenck.
